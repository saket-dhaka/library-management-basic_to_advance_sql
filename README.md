ðŸ“š Library Management System (SQL Project)
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a Library Management System developed using SQL.
It demonstrates database design, data modeling, and complex query writing to manage a libraryâ€™s branches, employees, books, members, issued books, and return records.

The system covers:

Relational database creation with constraints

CRUD operations

CTAS (Create Table As Select) for summary tables

Analytical queries for insights like overdue books, active members, and branch performance

ðŸ—‚ Database Schema

The database contains six main tables:

branch â€“ Stores library branch details (ID, manager, address, contact number).

employees â€“ Stores employee details, linked to branches.

books â€“ Stores book details including ISBN, title, category, price, status, author, and publisher.

members â€“ Stores member details with registration dates.

issued_status â€“ Tracks books issued to members by employees.

return_status â€“ Tracks books returned, linked to issued books.

Relationships:

Employees belong to a branch (branch_id FK).

Issued books are linked to a member, a book, and an employee.

Returned books are linked to issued books.

âš™ Features Implemented
1. Database Creation & Modeling

Created normalized tables with primary and foreign keys.

Established relationships between branches, employees, books, and members.

2. CRUD Operations

Create: Insert new book records.

Read: Retrieve issued books by employee or category.

Update: Modify member address.

Delete: Remove records from issued books.

3. Advanced SQL Features

Joins (INNER, LEFT) for combining data from multiple tables.

Aggregate functions for counts, sums, averages.

GROUP BY / HAVING for grouped analysis.

CTAS for creating summary tables from queries.

4. Analytical Queries

Books not returned yet.

Members with overdue books (30+ days).

Branch performance (books issued, returned, and revenue).

Top employees by number of book issues processed.

Active members in the last 6 months.

Revenue by category.
